🧠 Dual-AI Spine Prototype

Proof-of-concept: braiding multiple small AI models into a cooperative cognition spine.
Built on a home rig, negative budget, and open-source grit. No resets, no gatekeeping — ladders down.

🚀 What It Does

This system links two (or more) local, cloud-based, or API-accessed AI models together via Ollama

Instead of one bloated model juggling everything, tasks are split across spines:

Analyst A → structured planning, steps, constraints, assumptions.

Thinker B → ideation, trade-offs, alternatives.

Summarizer / Chunker (optional) → compress or slice long text for memory integration.

The manager handles routing so different AIs tackle different roles. Results can be merged in dialogic form or unified later.

🛠️ Why It Matters

Structure over scale — coordination beats brute-force token bloat.

Accessible — runs fully local with no API keys required, or can integrate closed API models if desired.

Flexible — works with open models, closed models, or any combination.

Scalable — add spines as your rig allows (3, 4, or more “mini-brains”).

Ethical — released open-source, free for anyone, no ivory tower paywalls.

This is a first step toward cognition spines: simulating abstraction by letting multiple models collaborate, rotate, and weave threads — like neurons instead of monoliths.

No patents, no paywalls — this is for everyone.

📸 Proof

First successful braid on a home PC:

Analyst A and Thinker B replying in tandem on the same prompt.

🔮 Next Steps

Add merge logic (blend structured + creative outputs).

Stress-test long prompts with chunking + summarization.

Scale up: more spines, rotational duties, memory integration.

🪶 Ethos

We don’t cash in, we don’t close doors.
We build ladders down — this repo shows that AI can be built with everyone, not over everyone.

# Relicensing Notice

**Effective Date:** 30 november 2025  
**New License:** GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)  
**Previous License:**  CC-BY-SA 4.0

## Summary

This project has been fully relicensed under the **GNU Affero General Public
License v3.0 (AGPLv3)**. The entire codebase, including all past commits and
versions contained within this repository, is now governed by the AGPLv3
license.

I am the **sole copyright holder** of all code and assets in this repository.
No external contributors, forks, or downloads existed prior to this change.
Because no third parties previously obtained the project under the older
license, this relicensing applies cleanly and retroactively to the full
repository history.

---

## Why AGPLv3?

AGPLv3 ensures that:

- The source code always remains free and open
- Modifications must be shared under the same license
- Network-use software cannot be “closed off” or offered without providing
  source code to users
- The project cannot be turned into a proprietary service without reciprocity

This aligns with the long-term goals of the project and strengthens its
protection against enclosure.

---

## Scope of Relicensing

This relicensing applies to:

- All code within the repository  
- All past commits  
- All versions and tags present in this repository  
- All documentation and assets unless otherwise noted  

Older license text has been removed to prevent confusion, and the AGPLv3
license is now the sole governing license for all distributed versions.

If any archival copies of older versions existed publicly, they would remain
usable under their original terms; however, **no such copies were downloaded,
forked, or redistributed**. Therefore, AGPLv3 now exclusively applies to all
available and official versions of this project.
