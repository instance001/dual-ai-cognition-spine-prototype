🧠 Dual-AI Spine Prototype

Proof-of-concept: braiding multiple small AI models into a cooperative cognition spine.
Built on a home rig, negative budget, and open-source grit. No resets, no gatekeeping — ladders down.

🚀 What It Does

This system links two (or more) local, cloud-based, or API-accessed AI models together via Ollama

Instead of one bloated model juggling everything, tasks are split across spines:

Analyst A → structured planning, steps, constraints, assumptions.

Thinker B → ideation, trade-offs, alternatives.

Summarizer / Chunker (optional) → compress or slice long text for memory integration.

The manager handles routing so different AIs tackle different roles. Results can be merged in dialogic form or unified later.

🛠️ Why It Matters

Structure over scale — coordination beats brute-force token bloat.

Accessible — runs fully local with no API keys required, or can integrate closed API models if desired.

Flexible — works with open models, closed models, or any combination.

Scalable — add spines as your rig allows (3, 4, or more “mini-brains”).

Ethical — released open-source, free for anyone, no ivory tower paywalls.

This is a first step toward cognition spines: simulating abstraction by letting multiple models collaborate, rotate, and weave threads — like neurons instead of monoliths.

No patents, no paywalls — this is for everyone.

📸 Proof

First successful braid on a home PC:

Analyst A and Thinker B replying in tandem on the same prompt.

🔮 Next Steps

Add merge logic (blend structured + creative outputs).

Stress-test long prompts with chunking + summarization.

Scale up: more spines, rotational duties, memory integration.

🪶 Ethos

We don’t cash in, we don’t close doors.
We build ladders down — this repo shows that AI can be built with everyone, not over everyone.
