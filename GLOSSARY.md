| Term | Alternate term(s) | Alt map | External map | Relation to existing terminology | What it is | What it is not | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dual-AI Spine Prototype | cognition spine | ~ | ~ | Multi-model collaboration pattern | Proof-of-concept that braids two or more models (e.g., Analyst A for planning, Thinker B for ideation, optional summarizer/chunker) coordinated via Ollama into a cooperative spine | Not a single large model; not scale-dependent; not patent-encumbered | dual-ai-cognition-spine-prototype/README.md |
| Spine roles | Analyst A, Thinker B, Summarizer/Chunker | = | ~ | Role decomposition | Role-specific model assignments: Analyst for structure/constraints, Thinker for alternatives, Summarizer for compression/memory integration | Not fixed architectures; roles can be reconfigured or expanded | dual-ai-cognition-spine-prototype/README.md |
| Manager/routing | spine manager | ~ | ~ | Coordination layer | Routing component that assigns tasks to appropriate spine models and merges dialogic outputs | Not autonomous AGI; not monolithic orchestration without human oversight | dual-ai-cognition-spine-prototype/README.md |
